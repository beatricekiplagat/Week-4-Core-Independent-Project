## Description

As a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company, I have been tasked to investigate a claim that on average, only all clients who take blue cars over the weekend, will return them during the weekend. The rest will return them during weekdays. Thus, we would like to check if the mean number of blue cars taken on Saturday/Sunday is equal to the mean number of blue cars returned on Saturday/Sunday, from the provided Autolib dataset.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.

To work on this project, we will perform the following analysis with Python;

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.
Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.
